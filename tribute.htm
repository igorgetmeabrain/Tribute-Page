<strong>Michael Herbert Johnson</strong> was born in Rainhill, Merseyside, the middle child of five. He trained initially as a sheet-metal worker, and then as a fault technician for British Leyland.
He was also artistic from an early age, drawing, painting and learning fine woodworking skills.
He created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquetry" target="_blank">marquetry</a> pictures and renovated antique
furniture, which his family continue to use to this day.

<p>
As a self-taught guitarist, he became a regular on the Merseyside folk-music scene, where, at the age of 21, he met his future wife, Elaine. She learned flute, tin-whistle and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhr%C3%A1n">bodhrán</a> and sang often at their sessions together.
Michael also picked up the fiddle and concertina, and they later joined the band <em>Seoda Ceoil</em>, alongside the renowned
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Family_(band)">Shay Black</a>.

<p>
Following the collapse of British Leyland in 1975, Michael took work as a taxi-driver and later as a milk round supervisor.
He also briefly studied violin-making in Liverpool, with Harry Hunter, with an eye on his future career.
Michael and Elaine also had three daughters, Sally, Aimée and Lucy, though they finally left Merseyside to start a new life near Hallbankgate, Cumbria in 1981, when Lucy was just two months old.
 The family lived on-site in a static caravan for over a year, whilst Michael made their new house habitable.
 Setting up his luthier’s business, he also worked as a repairer of school violins, for the local music service.
 Cumbria also allowed him to indulge his love for the hills, and he frequently walked with his family in the Lake District and was a keen climber too.

<p>
When the family moved once more, in 1992, to Penrith, a larger house and a better location allowed the business to flourish.
Michael quickly established himself as one of the most respected makers and restorers in the country, whilst also continuing to enjoy an active life of climbing and folk music.
The girls often accompanied their parents to music festivals, and they all learned to play the violin and were soon winning local music competitions.
Sally and Aimée went on to study at the Royal Northern College of Music, as a singer and violist respectively, before pursuing careers as professional musicians.
Lucy, meanwhile, studied at the Newark School of Violin Making, following her dad into the violin-making business.

<p>
Tragically, in the summer of 2001, whilst on holiday in Greece, Michael was killed in a road accident. He was only 53 and yet he left behind a great legacy as
a maker, businessman, family man and musician.
</p>
<p>
His reputation lives on, as do his instruments, which will continue to be played for generations to come.
