# Tribute Page (freeCodeCamp challenge)

This project was created to fulfil an element of the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp.  
The main aim of the project is to create a simple tribute page in order to learn how to use basic HTML and CSS elements and responsive image resizing.

## Project Criteria

The required user stories are:  
1. My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
2. I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page.
3. I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
4. Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
5. Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
6. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
7. I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
8. The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
9. The img element should be centered within its parent element.

The project is submitted via Codepen, using a CDN link to run tests to verify completion of the user stories:

## Design

This was my first ever coding project. I decided to use natural colours (e.g. greens and browns) to complement the subject of the page, with cursive font for the headers and semi-transparent content floating over a background image. Additional techniques which I explored in this project:
1. Box shadows, to create a 3D layered effect against the background image
2. Parallax effect. I initially created a static background image, but felt that parallax would bring the page to life a little more
3. Basic hover animation on the footer
4. Using css float to position images within the main text
5. A responsive resizing of the page, sizing all elements in relation to the width of the user's viewport
6. Media query to adapt screen layout and font-sizes for smaller displays (and portrait orientation)

## Conclusion

As my first project, there was a steep learning curve, especially implementing the parallax effect and media query successfully. All text was written by me.
